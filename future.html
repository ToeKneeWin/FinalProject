                    <h2>What will the future of Virtual Reality be like?</h2>
                    <h3>Realism</h3>
                    <p>Even though we've had VR technology since the 1950s, it's only become popular amongst consumers within the last decade.
                    As technology progresses VR will advance with it.
                    VR will become more immersive and realistic, making it harder to distinguish reality from virtual reality.
                    This can lead to possible trauma to users from experiencing something in VR.
                    This will bring up ethical issues of what kind of content developers should create for VR. 
                    On the other hand more immersive and realistic VR can be used to train people in certain fields and industries more accurately.
                    This can save companies a lot of money and limit dangers to personnel. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Security and Private Information</h3>
                    <p>Even though VR has been around for a while we're still learning how to properly keep it a safe place for users and consumers.
                    There are weaknesses in the security and people can exploit these weaknesses to steal other people's information.
                    In addition to worrying about hackers consumers should be wary of companies that may end up selling user information, behaviors, and actions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Addiction and Escaping</h3>
                    <p>With Facebook's purchase of Oculus VR it should be assumed that they'll be working on new ways to bring social media to the VR space. 
                    In our current society there is already an addiction to social media and technology and we don't know how this will affect those in the future using social media in VR.
                    As VR becomes more realistic and people become dissatisfied in their daily lives, There may be a desire to escape to VR and live a secondary life. 
                    This has already occured in the past with the simulation <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/second-life-leslie-jamison/544149/">Second Life</a>.
                    There needs to be appropriate education and warnings so that people dont' become addicted and spend all of their time in a virtual space</p>

                    <h3>Connection and Understanding</h3>
                    <p>I believe that with VR people will be able to connect with other people from all around the world like never before. 
                        People will be able to sit down with and talk bout or see the struggles of one another like never before. 
                        This has been done before with the <a href="https://www.rescue.org/article/how-virtual-reality-lets-us-see-syrian-refugee-crisis-fresh-eyes">Syrian refugee crisis</a>
                        This will allow a deeper understanding of those we don't interact with directly and hopefully bring our world closer together.</p>
